                            <p className="text-[18px]">Most studies reveal a higher amount of protein intake is beneficial for muscle gain. However, even with these studies, 
                            the number still remains a bit controversial

                            According to the <a href="https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-017-0177-8#Sec33" className="text-brand">International Society of Sports Nutrition</a>, individuals should consume 1.4 to 2.0 g of protein 
                            per kg(0.64 to 0.91 grams per lb) of bodyweight to optimize muscle gain. This recommendation aligns with the 
                            Institute of Medicineâ€™s Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range and can vary depending on factors such as 
                            exercise intensity, protein quality, and overall energy intake. Additionally, consuming protein post-workout or 
                            before sleep can enhance muscle protein synthesis and recovery, further supporting improvements in muscle size, 
                            strength, and body composition over time.

                            Based on this study, a man weighing 180 lbs would need to consume between 115.2 to 163.8g of protein per day to 
                            build muscle. A way bigger jump from our .8kg from before, but studies lean towards a higher protein diet for 
                            optimal muscle gain.
